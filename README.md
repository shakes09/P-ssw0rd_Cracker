# P-ssw0rd_Cracker
This script is an advanced, configurable password cracker that supports both brute-force and dictionary attacks using various hash algorithms.


The script is designed to demonstrate advanced password cracking techniques for educational purposes. It accepts a target hash and can run in two modes: a brute-force mode, which systematically tries all possible combinations from a specified character set up to a maximum length, and a dictionary mode, which attempts passwords from a provided word list. The script uses common hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1, or SHA256) to compute and compare hashes of candidate passwords with the target hash. It also tracks the number of attempts and the time taken to crack the password, providing detailed feedback upon completion. This level of configurability and detailed output helps illustrate the complexity and time involved in cracking password hashes, reinforcing the importance of strong password security.
